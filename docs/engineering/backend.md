# Backend standards

## Router → service → transaction

The former 2,517-line `backend/src/api/threads/workspaces.py` is now a
32-line compatibility shim: a docstring plus re-exports of `router` /
`standalone_router` and five more names
(`THREAD_PREVIEW_MAX_CHARS`, `create_workspace`, `add_workspace_member`,
`update_message_feedback`, `update_message_standalone`) that only
characterization/regression tests still import from this path directly
(`test_workspace_route_contract.py`, `test_workspace_tenant_scope.py`,
`test_workspace_member_readd.py`, `test_message_feedback_edit_guard.py`,
`test_create_message_route_deprecation.py`) — all seven are load-bearing,
not dead re-exports; the module's `__all__` is the definitive list. The
real layout:

- **Routers** (transport only): `backend/src/api/threads/workspace_routes/
  {workspaces,members,conversations,threads,messages,collections}.py`, plus
  two shared modules — `dependencies.py` (scope/access, raises
  `HTTPException`) and `presenters.py` (response shaping). Composed, in the
  original route-registration order, by `workspace_routes/__init__.py` into
  the two exported routers.
- **Services** (persistence + one transaction boundary per method):
  `backend/src/services/threads/{workspace,conversation,thread,message,
  collection}_service.py`, `workspace_access.py` (the one scope/access
  funnel), and `chat_service.py` (`ChatService` — a compatibility facade;
  see below).

Enforced by `backend/tests/unit/architecture/test_workspace_boundaries.py`:

1. No route module calls `.commit()` / `.rollback()` / `.flush()` /
   `.refresh()` — that's a service's job.
2. No resource module imports a sibling resource module directly — cross-
   handler helpers go through `dependencies.py` or `presenters.py` only.
3. `workspace_routes/__init__.py` and the `workspaces.py` shim resolve
   `router`/`standalone_router` to the same objects.

**Named exception, not a loophole**: `workspace_routes/messages.py`'s
`create_message`/`create_message_standalone` re-issue a read-only
`select(ChatMessage).options(selectinload(...))` after delegating the write
to `ChatService.create_message`, to eager-load citation/attachment metadata
for the response. That's a read, not a transaction boundary.

## Tenant / access scope

- Workspace access is **membership-based**, not organization-based:
  `workspace_access.user_can_access_workspace` = not deleted AND (public OR
  member OR owner). A workspace's `organization_id` is metadata recorded at
  creation, not an access filter — a public workspace is visible cross-org
  by design.
- Every `workspace_access.get_*` getter (`get_workspace`, `get_conversation`,
  `get_thread`, `get_message`, `get_collection`) requires `user_id` with no
  default and fails closed (returns `None`); router callers turn that into
  404 via `workspace_routes/dependencies.py`, `ChatService` uses the
  `Optional[...]` directly. Enforced by
  `backend/tests/unit/architecture/test_maintenance_contracts.py`.
- **Document access is organization-scoped** (per the repo-wide tenant
  rule): `workspace_access.get_accessible_document_or_none(db, document_id,
  user_id, organization_id)` filters `Document.organization_id` — every
  document / content-hash-dedup / search-suggestion query must filter
  `organization_id`, the same way.
- Soft-deletes don't cascade to child rows, only to access: deleting a
  workspace/conversation/thread stamps only that row's own `is_deleted`.
  `get_conversation`/`get_thread`/`get_message` each re-check every
  ancestor's `is_deleted` on every fetch — a `Workspace.is_deleted = True`
  must still revoke access to its conversations/threads/messages even
  though no cascade touched those rows.

## Compatibility-preserving consolidation

Where a router historically diverged from `ChatService` (measured during
the Task 4.3 consolidation — see the plan's amendment A2), the router's
endpoint keeps its own behavior, and `ChatService`'s pre-existing callers
keep their old behavior via an explicit flag defaulting to "old":
`workspace_service.create_workspace(..., enforce_org_match=True|False)`,
`list_workspaces(..., filter_deleted_memberships=True|False)`,
`delete_workspace(..., stamp_deleted_at=True|False)`. Read a service
function's docstring before assuming its default matches every caller —
they usually don't, on purpose.

Keep a compatibility export until every caller has migrated (see
`backend/src/api/threads/workspaces.py`); removing one is a separate,
deliberate change, not a side effect of an unrelated refactor.

## Ratchets

- **Ruff `F821`/`F823`** (undefined name / used-before-assignment) are
  blocking, repo-wide: `ruff check backend/src`. These are latent
  `NameError`s, not style — the rest of the default rule set is either
  ignored (see `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.ruff.lint]`) or advisory.
- **Changed-file gate** (CI `lint-backend`, blocking): every changed
  `.py` file (`scripts/ci/changed_source_files.py --kind python`) must pass
  `ruff check`, `black --check`, `isort --check-only`. *Added* files only
  (`--kind python-added`) additionally run
  `mypy --ignore-missing-imports --follow-imports=silent` — modified legacy
  files carry too much pre-existing type debt (measured: 529 errors across
  one 27-file sample) to gate on until that debt is paid down.
- Full-tree Black/isort/MyPy stay **advisory**
  (`continue-on-error: true` in CI) until their debt reaches zero — see
  [testing.md](testing.md) for how to move a floor.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s local hooks run the *exact same* pinned
  `ruff`/`black`/`isort` commands as CI, staged-file scoped — never a
  separately-pinned mirror. `scripts/ci/check_tool_versions.py` (+
  `backend/tests/unit/ci/test_tool_versions.py`) fails if they drift apart.

## Commands

Run every blocking gate across the branch before pushing —
`scripts/ci/run_local_ci.sh` (add `--frontend` for the pnpm checks). It
ratchets changed files against the base branch the way CI does, which
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` cannot: pre-commit only sees the files being staged,
so one formatted in an earlier commit and edited later still fails CI.

```sh
scripts/ci/run_local_ci.sh              # blocking gates + unit tests
scripts/ci/run_local_ci.sh --skip-tests # gates only

ruff check backend/src
black --check backend/src
isort --check-only backend/src
mypy backend/src --ignore-missing-imports   # advisory, full-tree baseline
pytest -q backend/tests/unit/architecture backend/tests/unit/api
pytest -q backend/tests/unit/services/threads backend/tests/api/threads
python scripts/ci/generate_openapi.py --check
```
