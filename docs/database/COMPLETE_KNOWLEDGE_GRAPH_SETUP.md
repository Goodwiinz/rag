- Stored in Neo4j with metadata
- No action required!

**2. Backfill Script (Existing Documents)**
- Process documents already in database
- Smart skip logic (avoids reprocessing)
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Full statistics and progress tracking

**3. Knowledge Graph with 142 Entities**

**By Type**:
- 74 OTHER
- 25 ORGANIZATIONS
- 11 CONCEPTS
- 9 PEOPLE
- 9 LOCATIONS
- 9 DATES
- 2 PRODUCTS
- 1 EMAIL, 1 PHONE, 1 URL

## Quick Commands

### View Your Knowledge Graph

```bash
# Open Neo4j Browser
open http://localhost:7474

# Login: neo4j / neo4jpassword
```

### Process More Documents

```bash
# See what would be processed
docker exec rag-backend-1 python /app/examples/backfill_knowledge_graph.py --dry-run

# Process all remaining documents
docker exec rag-backend-1 python /app/examples/backfill_knowledge_graph.py

# Process in smaller batches
docker exec rag-backend-1 python /app/examples/backfill_knowledge_graph.py --batch-size 5 --limit 20
```

### Query Your Knowledge Graph

**In Neo4j Browser** (http://localhost:7474):

```cypher
// See all entities
MATCH (n:Entity) RETURN n LIMIT 25

// Count by type
MATCH (e:Entity)
RETURN e.type, count(e) as count
ORDER BY count DESC

// Find organizations
MATCH (e:Entity)
WHERE e.type = 'ORGANIZATION'
RETURN e.name, e.confidence_score
LIMIT 20

// Find people
MATCH (e:Entity)
WHERE e.type = 'PERSON'
RETURN e.name, e.confidence_score
LIMIT 20

// Search for specific entity
MATCH (e:Entity)
WHERE e.name CONTAINS 'Tech'
RETURN e.name, e.type
```

## Sample Entities Found

From your existing documents, the system found:

**People**:
- Alice Johnson
- Bob Smith
- Sarah Williams
- Dr. Jane Smith

**Organizations**:
- AI Research Lab
- TechStart Inc
- InnovateTech Solutions
- TechCorp Solutions
- Google
- Microsoft
- Stanford University

**Locations**:
- San Francisco
- New York
- California

**Concepts**:
- Machine Learning
- Cloud Computing
- Artificial Intelligence
- Deep Learning

## How to Use

### For New Documents

1. Go to your frontend
2. Upload any document (PDF, text, image, etc.)
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Entities automatically extracted and stored!
5. View in Neo4j Browser

### For Existing Documents

Already done for your 3 documents! If you add more documents directly to the database:

```bash
# Process them with the backfill script
docker exec rag-backend-1 python /app/examples/backfill_knowledge_graph.py
```

### Query via API

```bash
# Search entities
curl http://localhost:8000/knowledge-graph/entities/search?query=TechCorp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get entity details
curl http://localhost:8000/knowledge-graph/entities/{entity_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Find related entities
curl http://localhost:8000/knowledge-graph/entities/{entity_id}/related?max_depth=2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## What's Working

✅ **Entity Extraction**
- spaCy NER with en_core_web_sm model
- 13+ entity types supported
- Confidence scores preserved
- Context extraction

✅ **Knowledge Graph Storage**
- Neo4j integration complete
- Automatic storage on upload
- Backfill for existing documents
- Metadata tracking

✅ **Pipeline Integration**
- Added to document processing
- Non-blocking (won't fail pipeline)
- Background processing
- Progress tracking

✅ **Documentation**
- Complete guides created
- Test scripts available
- API reference included
- Troubleshooting help

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `backend/examples/store_knowledge_graph_data.py` - Manual storage examples
- `backend/examples/test_auto_knowledge_graph.py` - Integration tests
- `backend/examples/backfill_knowledge_graph.py` - Process existing docs

### Documentation
- `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_GUIDE.md` - Complete reference
- `AUTO_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_INTEGRATION.md` - Integration details
- `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
- `COMPLETE_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SETUP.md` - This file

### Modified Code
- `src/services/multimodal_processing_service.py` - Added KG storage step
- `src/services/multimodal_processing_service.py` - Added `store_entities_in_knowledge_graph` method

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Add Relationship Extraction
Currently only entities are extracted. To add relationships:
- Implement relationship detection in entity extraction
- Store relationships in knowledge graph
- Link related entities

### 2. Implement Deduplication
Avoid duplicate entities:
- Search before creating
- Merge similar entities
- Update confidence scores

### 3. Improve Extraction Quality
- Upgrade spaCy model (larger model)
- Add LLM-based extraction
- Custom extraction rules
- Fine-tune confidence thresholds

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Show extracted entities in UI
- Entity highlighting in documents
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Entity search and filter

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
- Track extraction metrics
- Graph growth over time
- Entity type distribution
- Quality scores

## Troubleshooting

### No new entities appearing?

```bash
# Check services running
docker ps

# Check backend logs
docker logs rag-backend-1 --tail 50

# Verify Neo4j connection
docker exec rag-backend-1 python3 -c "
from src.services.knowledge_graph_service import knowledge_graph_service
print('Neo4j connected:', knowledge_graph_service.driver is not None)
"
```

### Want to reprocess documents?

```bash
# Reprocess even if already have entities
docker exec rag-backend-1 python /app/examples/backfill_knowledge_graph.py --reprocess-all
```

### Check extraction quality?

Query in Neo4j Browser:

```cypher
// Find low confidence entities
MATCH (e:Entity)
WHERE e.confidence_score < 0.7
RETURN e.name, e.type, e.confidence_score
ORDER BY e.confidence_score
LIMIT 20
```
