# Fix Progress Report - Updated

## Completed Fixes (Session 2)

### GitHub Workflows ✅
1. **ci-cd-pipeline.yml**
   - Fixed service health checks with proper polling loop (300s timeout)
   - Implemented real deployment steps with SSH authentication
   - Added database migration with rollback on failure
   - Implemented smoke tests with retries
   - Added rollback step on deployment failure

2. **monitoring.yml**
   - Added psycopg2-binary installation before database check
   - Added redis package installation before Redis check
   - Fixed performance test conditional to include workflow_dispatch
   - Added -y flag to k6 installation
   - Fixed API URL validation to fail fast when not configured

## Previously Completed (Session 1)

### Frontend

1. **package.json** ✅
   - Removed `@types/react-router-dom` since v6 ships its own types
   - Installed `uuid` and `@types/uuid` packages

2. **BatchUploadManager.tsx** ✅
   - Fixed stale closure in `simulateProcessing` using `isPausedRef`
   - Removed hardcoded `user_id` and `organization_id`, now using auth context
   - Added validation to ensure auth info exists before creating documents

3. **DocumentMetadataEditor.tsx** ✅
   - Removed `as any` type assertion
   - Created `DocumentMetadataPayload` interface
   - Made `handleInputChange` generic with proper types

4. **DocumentUploader.tsx** ✅
   - Replaced `Math.random()` with `uuidv4()` for ID generation
   - Added `useEffect` cleanup for object URLs to prevent memory leaks
   - Removed inline `onLoad` handler from image element

5. **DocumentPreview.tsx** ✅
   - Implemented `handleRetry` function with proper API call
   - Added retry button for failed documents
   - Added optimistic UI updates and toast notifications
