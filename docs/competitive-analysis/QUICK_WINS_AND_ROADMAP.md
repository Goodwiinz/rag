# Quick Wins & Roadmap Summary

## 🚀 Immediate Quick Wins (This Sprint)

### 1. **Inline Citation Links** — 2-3 days
```
BEFORE: "Studies show X is effective"
AFTER: "Studies show X is effective [1, 2]" with clickable links to source
```
**Why:** Every competitor does this. It's table stakes for research trust.

### 2. **Evidence Agreement Meter** — 1-2 days
Visual indicator: "🟢 8 of 10 sources agree" or "🟡 Mixed evidence (5 agree, 3 disagree)"
**Why:** Consensus.app's killer feature. Easy to implement, high user trust impact.

### 3. **BibTeX/RIS Export Button** — 1 day
Export search results to standard citation formats.
**Why:** Researchers live in Zotero/Mendeley. Friction killer.

### 4. **Retraction Warning Badge** — 2 days
Call Crossref API on document ingest. Show "⚠️ RETRACTED" badge if flagged.
**Why:** Research integrity is trending. Easy win for credibility.

### 5. **Reproducibility Hash** — 1 day
Show: `Query fingerprint: abc123` — hash of query + model version + index version
**Why:** Proves determinism. Unique to your positioning.

## 💰 Revenue Positioning

| Tier | Price | Key Features |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 10 queries/day, basic search |
| **Researcher** | $15/mo | Unlimited search, exports, citations |
| **Pro** | $45/mo | Systematic review, knowledge graph, multimodal |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Audit trails, SSO, custom domains, SLA |

**Insight:** Elicit charges $42/mo for Pro. Your multimodal + determinism features justify similar or higher pricing.

## 🏆 Competitive Moat Checklist

Your unique combination NO competitor has:

- [x] **Multimodal** — PDF, images, audio, video (competitors are text-only)
- [x] **Knowledge Graph** — Neo4j for relationship discovery
- [x] **Multi-Agent** — CrewAI specialized agents
- [ ] **Deterministic** — Reproducible outputs (implement and market!)
- [ ] **Full Audit Trail** — Query → Search → Rank → Answer provenance

Build these 5 together = defensible position.
