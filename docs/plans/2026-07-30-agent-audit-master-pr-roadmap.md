# Agent Audit Master PR Roadmap

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:executing-plans` to
> implement this plan task-by-task.
>
> **For OpenCode:** Treat each row in the delivery map as a separate PR unless
> the row explicitly says it is a verification-only gate. Branch every PR from
> the latest `origin/develop`; do not stack sibling PRs unless the dependency
> column requires it.

**Goal:** Convert the agent production audit into an independently mergeable
P0/P1/P2 delivery program with explicit dependencies, evidence, rollout gates,
and ownership boundaries.

**Architecture:** P0 establishes the authoritative durable execution and
streaming contract. P1 operates that contract safely under failure, load, and
multi-store drift. P2 reduces the architectural mechanisms that make future
contract drift and reliability regressions likely. PostgreSQL remains the
source of truth, Redis is a wakeup/cache layer, Celery owns durable execution,
and SSE is a typed projection of the durable event ledger.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL, Redis,
Celery, LangGraph, Next.js, TypeScript, WHATWG SSE, OpenAPI 3.1, RFC 9457,
OpenTelemetry, LangSmith, Prometheus/Grafana, pytest, Vitest, Playwright, Helm,
ArgoCD.

## Source of truth

- Audit baseline: `docs/system-design-audit-2026-07-10.md`.
- Existing P0 implementation detail:
  `docs/plans/2026-07-30-full-agent-p0-implementation.md`.
- P0 PR split: `docs/plans/2026-07-30-agent-audit-p0-pr-plan.md`.
- P1 PR split: `docs/plans/2026-07-30-agent-audit-p1-pr-plan.md`.
- P2 PR split: `docs/plans/2026-07-30-agent-audit-p2-pr-plan.md`.

The 2026-07-10 audit is historical evidence, not current truth. Before changing
code, re-run each plan's preflight against the current `origin/develop` and
record the finding as `closed`, `partial`, `open`, or `regressed`.

## Priority definition

| Tier | Meaning                                                                              | Merge/deploy rule                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| P0   | Accepted work, tenant isolation, stream integrity, or release safety can be violated | Blocks agent production promotion                     |
| P1   | Recovery, scaling, observability, or cross-store convergence is incomplete           | Must finish before sustained production traffic       |
| P2   | Maintainability and platform consistency debt increases future failure rate          | Schedule after P0/P1; adopt incrementally where noted |

| Full route SLO/quality release gate | Partial                              | Small benchmark exists; 100+ case reliability/quality gate does not                           |

## Program rules

1. One behavioral concern per PR; migrations may accompany only the code that
   consumes them.
2. Every PR begins with a failing contract or failure-injection test.
3. Every PR updates its relevant runbook and rollback lever.
4. No PR may weaken organization scoping, the uniform 404 IDOR posture, HITL
   confirmation, or prompt/trace redaction.
5. Every database idempotency rule is enforced by a unique constraint or
   compare-and-swap update, not only application code.
6. Metrics use bounded server-owned labels only. Organization, user, thread,
   message, prompt, document, trace ID, tool arguments, and exception messages
   are forbidden metric labels.
7. Deploy each change to dev through ArgoCD, observe one full synthetic/load
   window, then promote. Do not manually mutate live workloads except an
   explicitly documented emergency rollback.

## Full-program acceptance

- P0 release gate passes with at least 100 representative cases.
- Accepted messages lost: zero.
- Duplicate persisted user/assistant messages: zero.
- Malformed or multiply-terminal SSE streams: zero.
- Resume success: at least 99% by route.
- Fast route accepted p95 is at most 250 ms; TTFT and completion p95 are at
  most 5 seconds for the versioned benchmark corpus.
- Graph/research SLOs are separate and pass their task-specific budgets.
- Injected PostgreSQL, Redis, worker, and pod failures recover according to the
  durable execution contract.
- Every active alert links to a tested runbook and rollback.
- The original audit ledger has a current status and evidence link for all 35
  findings.
