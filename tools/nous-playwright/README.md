# NOUS: conversation-to-project Playwright test

Automates the workflow demonstrated on goodwiinz.tech: inspect **Attention Is All You Need**, ask a question, create a project through chat, approve creation and document attachment, and verify the saved paper after reload.

## Run locally

Use the repository-pinned Node 24 and pnpm 10.18.2. From `tools/nous-playwright`:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --ignore-workspace
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm auth
pnpm test:headed
pnpm report
```

`--ignore-workspace` keeps this standalone package separate from the root workspace install and lockfile. This handoff is not yet integrated into the repository E2E suite.

`pnpm auth` opens a normal browser. Sign in there, then return to the terminal and press Enter. No password is embedded in the code, read from this conversation, or entered in the terminal. Login is outside the recorded test. The resulting `.auth/nous.json` is a private authenticated session file and is ignored by Git.

The account must have the indexed paper available. The default document ID is the one verified in the demo. For another deployment, set the matching ID **for the same paper**:

```bash
export NOUS_BASE_URL='https://your-nous-deployment.example'
export NOUS_PAPER_ID='your-indexed-paper-uuid'
pnpm auth
pnpm test:headed
```

`NOUS_AUTH_STATE` optionally changes the state-file path. These are shell environment variables; this package does not automatically load `.env` files. Run `pnpm auth` again when the session expires.

## What the test checks

1. The source exists, is ready for retrieval, and its summary mentions attention mechanisms.
2. A new chat returns an **assistant** answer about self-attention with a link naming the source and containing its document ID. User text cannot satisfy the answer assertion.
3. The project-creation approval contains the unique requested project name and no extra actions.
4. The attachment approval refers to the expected paper. A separate browser page verifies that the target project has the expected name and is still empty before attachment approval.
5. The real project-documents API response and the UI both show the paper after approval.
6. A full reload still shows exactly one membership with the expected project ID, document ID, title, and indexed status.

One worker and zero automatic retries prevent parallel runs and automatic retry-created projects. Each invocation creates a uniquely named `NOUS E2E - Transformer Research - ...` project and a conversation. They remain for inspection; `created-resources.json` in the report identifies them. The original paper is never deleted.

## Artifacts

- Video from every test run: `test-results/**/video.webm` (Playwright saves it when the browser context closes).
- Seven named screenshots and created-resource metadata in the HTML report.
- A trace and additional screenshot retained on failure.
- View the report with `pnpm report`; open a downloaded trace using `pnpm exec playwright show-trace path/to/trace.zip`.

Treat authenticated traces, videos, and session files as private. The test never records the login form, but its later artifacts contain your workspace content.

## Scope and validation

The selectors and workflow were derived from the live NOUS walkthrough and checked against the current repository components. This package has been checked with Playwright test discovery; the automated authenticated test has **not** been run here. The earlier manual walkthrough is separate evidence.

This is a real-service integration test with a three-minute budget per agent transition. If the model asks an extra clarification, proposes another tool, chooses the wrong document, fails to finish, or duplicates final assistant rows, the test fails rather than accepting a different workflow. Inspect its trace before changing an assertion.

It does not prove broad answer faithfulness, measure latency percentiles, or validate the citation link's navigation destination. During the manual walkthrough the dedicated Search page returned no result for a sentence query; this test exercises the working Chat route.

This is standalone and does not invoke the repository's older global setup, teardown, web-server startup, or seeded default credentials. Invoke this folder's own config. See `CODEX_HANDOFF.md` for continuation and eventual integration into `tests/e2e/`.
