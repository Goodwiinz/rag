### Issue: Infinite redirects
**Solution**: Check auth logic in `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`

### Issue: Styles not loading
**Solution**: Ensure CSS is imported in `src/app/layout.tsx`

### Issue: API calls failing
**Solution**: Check Next.js proxy configuration in `next.config.js`

### Issue: React Query not working
**Solution**: Verify QueryProvider is in the layout

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Lint
npm run lint

npm test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Next Steps After Testing

1. [ ] All tests passing
2. [ ] Remove old files: `rm -rf src/pages src/router src/App.tsx src/index.tsx`
3. [ ] Update navigation from React Router to Next.js
4. [ ] Optimize components for Next.js
5. [ ] Deploy to production
