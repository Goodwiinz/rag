"""Synthetic agent-traffic generator for the NOUS dev cluster.

Drives the compiled LangGraph agent in-process (no HTTP) with a real
Postgres session and a dedicated synthetic user so every run produces
LangSmith traces in ``rag-agent-dev`` — exactly the same project and
signal shape as real user traffic.

Scheduling
----------
A Kubernetes CronJob (``templates/synthetic-traffic-cronjob.yaml``) runs
this every 20 minutes on the dev cluster via::

    python -m scripts.synthetic_traffic [--rotate|--all|--scenario <key>|--cleanup]

To disable: set ``syntheticTraffic.enabled: false`` in ``values-dev.yaml``
and let ArgoCD sync.  No code changes needed.

Cleanup
-------
Every run (unless ``--cleanup`` is passed alone) ends with a lightweight
cleanup pass that soft-deletes Collections owned by the synthetic user
whose names start with ``synthtraffic-`` and that were created more than
6 hours ago, preventing accumulation of junk in the dev database.

    prose and called nothing is indistinguishable from a successful ingest —

    wandered off into ``list_projects`` instead of retrying. Interrupt fired,
