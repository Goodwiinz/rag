"""CLI-token revocation via a per-user "revoked before" timestamp.

CLI tokens are long-lived (CLI_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS, default 30) and otherwise
only signature+exp validated, so a leaked token of an *active* user could not
be invalidated without deactivating the user. This module records, per user, a
Redis timestamp before which all CLI tokens are considered revoked; the auth
chokepoint (get_current_user) rejects a CLI token whose issued-at predates it.

Design: revoke-all-for-user (no per-jti tracking). Availability semantics on a
revocation-store failure are configurable (audit D7):

* MISS (store reachable, no revoked-before cutoff for the user) -> ALLOW,
  always. A plain miss must never break CLI auth platform-wide.
* ERROR (store unreachable / Redis raises / no client) -> governed by
  ``CLI_TOKEN_REVOCATION_FAIL_CLOSED``. Default False keeps the historical
  FAIL-OPEN (allow) so a Redis outage never breaks CLI auth; flip to True to
  FAIL-CLOSED (deny) so an outage or failover can no longer silently
  un-revoke every revoked CLI token. Either way the unavailability is logged
  loudly.

A Redis *flush* wipes the cutoff key and thus reads as a MISS (not an error),
so fail-closed alone cannot catch it; exposure from a lost cutoff is instead
bounded by the CLI-token max-age cap enforced at the auth chokepoint
(``get_current_user_token``) — the token ages out within the configured
lifetime rather than staying valid forever.
