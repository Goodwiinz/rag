"""Celery execution backend for agent /execute turns + agent-run sweeper.

Audit P1.3 + P1.4 (findings X1 dispatch/recovery halves, D7 stuck-job half).

Dispatch (flag-gated by ``AGENT_DISPATCH_BACKEND=celery``, default
``background``): the API commits the ``agent_runs`` row (+ idempotency key)
and writes the Redis job record BEFORE publishing (flush-before-external),
then ``run_agent_job`` claims the row's one-shot execution lease and drives
``agent_execution_service._run_agent_graph`` — the exact coroutine the
FastAPI BackgroundTasks path runs, so both backends share one runner and one
status protocol.

Idempotency: ``agent_run_service.claim_execution`` succeeds at most once per
run (atomic ``queued`` → ``running`` plus ``lease_owner IS NULL``; an unleased
legacy ``running`` row is accepted during rollout), so a duplicate delivery
(acks_late redelivery, broker retry, double publish) no-ops instead of
double-running a turn whose tools may have side effects. A redelivery after a
crash *before* the claim still finds the lease free and legitimately recovers
the turn.

HITL: confirm/resume stays on the API pod BY DESIGN in both modes. The resume
re-enters the graph through the Postgres checkpointer (keyed by thread_id),
which every pod reaches; the Redis CAS on the job record already dedupes
concurrent confirms. Keeping it request-local means the confirming user gets
the same latency in both modes and this task never needs to carry resume
state.

Event-loop boundary: the agent stack caches loop-bound singletons (the
LangGraph checkpointer's AsyncConnectionPool, the job store's Redis client,
the SQLAlchemy async engine). A bare ``asyncio.run`` per task would strand
them on a dead loop after the first task, so every coroutine here runs on the
shared ``_async_utils.run_async`` boundary: ONE persistent background event
loop per worker process (``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` on a daemon thread),
created lazily and fork-safe via a PID guard. The same loop is reused across
tasks, so the loop-bound singletons survive between turns. Children are
recycled every 100 tasks (``worker_max_tasks_per_child``); a recycled child
lazily recreates its own loop on first use. This module previously hosted its
own bespoke ``_get_worker_loop``/``_run_coro`` pair; it was consolidated onto
``run_async`` (its superset) so there is exactly one loop + one boundary
implementation across all Celery tasks.
