"""Lost-job reconciler (PR 1, Task 1.4).

The post-commit enqueue helpers (``src.tasks.enqueue``) fire a job's Celery
dispatch on ``after_commit`` — durable-then-dispatch, closing the
worker-reads-before-commit race. The residual failure mode: the broker is down
in the narrow window *after* the row commits, so the dispatch never lands. The
row is durable but no worker ever sees it — ``status=PENDING`` /
``celery_task_id IS NULL`` forever.

This beat task recovers exactly that class. Every
``LOST_JOB_RECONCILE_AFTER_MINUTES`` (default 10, well under the 30-min
stuck-job sweep so recovery runs first) it selects PENDING, non-deleted,
never-dispatched (``celery_task_id IS NULL``) rows untouched for that long and
re-enqueues each the same way its origin site did (see ``_REENQUEUE_BY_JOB_TYPE``).
Each re-enqueue bumps the attempt counter (``retry_count`` — a never-started
job's counter is otherwise untouched, so there is no collision with the worker's
own retry bookkeeping); after ``LOST_JOB_RECONCILE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` (default 3) the
job is marked FAILED instead.

Complements ``sweep_stuck_processing_jobs`` (which mark-fails jobs that *were*
dispatched but stalled mid-flight): this one re-drives jobs that were *never*
dispatched. Idempotent across an immediate double-run — a re-enqueue bumps
``updated_at``, dropping the row out of the stale window until it goes silent
again. Re-delivery to a worker is harmless: the processing tasks guard against
redelivery (they no-op a job already past PENDING). Tenant-agnostic system task.
Flag-gated by ``LOST_JOB_RECONCILER_ENABLED`` (independent kill switch).
