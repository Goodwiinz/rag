"""Atomic replay/idempotency claim for acks_late Celery redelivery.

``celery_app`` sets ``task_acks_late=True`` (``celery_app.py``), so a worker
killed mid-task — OOM eviction, HPA scale-down, pod restart — never acks its
message and the broker redelivers it. Redelivery can therefore hit a job that a
*previous* delivery already finished (terminal state), one that is *still*
running on another worker, or one whose worker died mid-run (a stale ``RUNNING``
row). ``claim_job_for_processing`` gives the document-processing tasks a single,
atomic decision so a replay never re-does finished work, never double-processes
a live run, and safely takes over an abandoned one.

No new infrastructure: the decision reads only the existing
``ProcessingJob.status`` + ``started_at`` columns, and the claim is serialized
with ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the job row.
