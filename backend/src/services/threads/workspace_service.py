"""
Workspace and workspace-member persistence (Task 4.3 consolidation).

Canonical owner for workspace CRUD and member management — the router-inline
copy in ``backend/src/api/threads/workspace_routes/{workspaces,members}.py``
and ``ChatService``'s workspace methods both called into this module's
predecessor logic independently; this is now the one implementation.

Divergence flags (see docs/plans/2026-07-15-maintainability-foundation.md
Task 4.3 + its 2026-07-16 amendment A2): the router and ``ChatService``
diverged on two workspace concerns pre-4.3. Router semantics were always
canonical for the endpoints the router serves; ``ChatService``'s own callers
initially kept the old (unsafe) observed behavior via an explicit flag
defaulting to that old value. A follow-up tenant-gap fix (see
``chat_service.py``'s ``create_workspace``/``list_workspaces``) switched
``ChatService`` onto the router-safe value for both, after which the
defaults here were flipped fail-closed — passing the permissive value now
requires an explicit, justified opt-out:

- ``enforce_org_match`` (create): router raises on a cross-org create
  request; ``ChatService.create_workspace`` used to trust the caller's
  ``organization_id`` verbatim (a pre-existing tenant gap on the
  ``conversations.py`` endpoint it backs) and now enforces the same guard.
- ``filter_deleted_memberships`` (list): router excludes a workspace the
  caller was removed from (soft-deleted ``WorkspaceMember`` row);
  ``ChatService.list_workspaces`` used to not filter it, so a removed
  member still saw the workspace (another pre-existing tenant gap), and
  now filters it too.

Workspace member management (add/update/remove) has no ``ChatService``
duplicate to reconcile — it was router-only before this split — so those
three functions are a straight move, no flag.
