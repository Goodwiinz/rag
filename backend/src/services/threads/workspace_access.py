"""
Canonical scope/access funnel for the workspace resource hierarchy
(workspace -> conversation -> thread -> message; workspace -> collection).

Task 4.3 consolidation. Before this module the same access chain existed in
two divergent places:

- ``backend/src/api/threads/workspace_routes/dependencies.py`` (router-inline,
  raised ``HTTPException(404)``, always eager-loaded the relationships every
  response needs).
- ``ChatService`` (returned ``None`` on failure, minimal eager-loading, plus
  explicit soft-deleted-*parent* cascade guards — a delete never cascades to
  children, so a child row's own ``is_deleted`` flag staying False doesn't
  mean it's still reachable).

Both encode the same net access predicate (soft-delete-aware; public OR
member OR owner) — this module is now the one implementation. Callers that
want the router's raise-404 behavior wrap these in
``workspace_routes/dependencies.py``; ``ChatService`` calls them directly
since its own callers already expect ``Optional[...]``.

Access-model note: access to a workspace (and everything nested under it) is
granted by explicit membership (a ``WorkspaceMember`` row), ownership, or
because the workspace is public — NOT by organization co-location. A
workspace's ``organization_id`` is metadata recorded at creation, not a
filter on who may join or view it (a public workspace is visible cross-org
by design; a member can be invited from any org). Tenant scoping for
*documents* attached under a workspace (collection contents, message
attachments) is a separate, real predicate, enforced here by
``get_accessible_document_or_none`` and — for message attachments,
out of scope for this consolidation — ``ChatService._filter_owned_document_ids``.
