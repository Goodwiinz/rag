"""
Thread persistence (Task 4.3 consolidation).

Canonical owner for thread CRUD — the router-inline copy in
``backend/src/api/threads/workspace_routes/threads.py`` (nested +
standalone) and ``ChatService``'s thread methods both implemented this
independently; this is now the one implementation.

PR 3 Task 3.2: these functions no longer own the request commit — they
``flush()`` and the route (or, for ChatService's own callers, the ChatService
method) issues the single ``await db.commit()`` at the end of the mutating
path. The old ``commit: bool`` flag on ``create_thread`` is gone (create is now
unconditionally flush-only, which is exactly what its live ``threads.py`` caller
already relied on — that route does further work, project auto-link + WS
broadcast, then commits once). ``update_thread``'s resolve-summary enqueue moved
to ``enqueue_after_commit`` so it fires on the caller's commit, not at flush.

Divergence flags (Task 4.3 amendment A2):

- ``trigger_resolve_summary`` (update, status -> RESOLVED): pre-4.3,
  ``ChatService.update_thread`` compared ``data.status`` (``schemas.chat.
  ThreadStatus``) directly against ``src.models.ThreadStatus.RESOLVED`` —
  two distinct Enum classes that never compare equal, so the summary task
  never actually fired through that path; the router-inline update
  endpoints never had this trigger at all. Every current caller therefore
  observes "never fires." This consolidation fixes the comparison (values
  now normalized before comparing), so the trigger *could* fire — but per
  the amendment, a genuine behavioral fix like this stays behind a flag
  defaulting to the old (never-fires) behavior. Default ``False`` for every
  caller (``ChatService.update_thread``, the nested and standalone
  router endpoints); no caller currently opts in, so live behavior is
  unchanged pending a separate product decision to enable it.

A capability gap, not a conflict (adding it changes nothing for existing
callers that don't ask for it):

- ``with_preview`` (list): the router-inline list endpoints compute a
  correlated last-message-preview subquery per thread that
  ``ChatService.list_threads`` never supported. Default ``False`` (bare
  thread list, unchanged signature for ``threads.py``'s live
  ``threads, total = await service.list_threads(...)`` call); ``True``
  additionally returns a ``{thread_id: preview}`` dict.
