"""
Chat Service for Terminal Observatory thread-centric chat persistence.

Provides CRUD operations for workspaces, conversations, threads, and messages.

Task 4.3 consolidated the workspace/conversation/thread/message/collection
CRUD concerns that used to be duplicated between this class and the
``workspace_routes`` router-inline implementations into single owners under
``src/services/threads/{workspace,conversation,thread,message,collection}_service.py``
(+ the shared ``workspace_access`` funnel). Most methods below now delegate
to those modules, each passing the flag that reproduces this class's own
pre-4.3 behavior — see each method's docstring and
``docs/plans/2026-07-15-maintainability-foundation.md`` Task 4.3 (+ its
2026-07-16 amendment) for the specific divergence each flag preserves.

Out of scope for that consolidation, unchanged: ``create_message``,
``create_assistant_message``, ``_filter_owned_document_ids``,
``get_thread_context``, ``bulk_update_threads``, ``bulk_delete_threads``,
``bulk_summarize_threads``, ``search_conversations``, ``get_workspace_stats``.
