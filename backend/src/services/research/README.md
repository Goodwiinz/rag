# Research services

This package contains the business logic for research projects, document ingestion from arXiv, citation management, draft generation, and writing assistance. It is one layer below the API routers and above the database models; the agent (LangGraph) calls into `citation_extraction_service` and `project_memory_service` directly on the hot path.

## arXiv integration

arXiv ingestion lives in `../arxiv/arxiv_service.py` (`ArXivIngestionService`) and is called by `citation_extraction_service.py`.

**Timeouts and rate limits.** The arXiv API requires at least 3 seconds between requests (enforced via a class-level monotonic timestamp). Individual HTTP calls use a 20-second `httpx` timeout. At most one 429 retry is attempted with a 3-second wait; further rate limiting raises `IngestionError` immediately so the agent can report the failure rather than hanging inside a tool call. When using the arXiv service from an agent tool, call the endpoint via `postWithLongTimeout` (5-minute timeout) — the network round-trip plus PDF download can exceed the default 30-second tool timeout.

**ID handling after ingest.** After a successful ingest call the response contains `document_ids` — these are PostgreSQL UUIDs assigned by the documents service. Do not use the arXiv paper IDs (e.g., `2301.00001`) to reference ingested documents downstream; they are only stored as metadata. All subsequent tool calls (search, KG queries, draft generation) expect `document_ids` as UUIDs.

**Citation extraction fallback chain.** `CitationExtractionService` first tries the arXiv API for papers with a known `arxiv_id`, then Semantic Scholar and CrossRef for DOI-based lookup, then PDF text parsing, and finally accepts a manual entry. All extracted citations are stored in PostgreSQL and optionally synced to Neo4j via `CitationGraphService.sync_citation_to_graph`.

## Connections to other services

- **Documents service** (`src/api/documents/`): arXiv ingest writes document records there; the research services read them back via SQLAlchemy sessions.
- **Search service** (`src/services/search/`): `ArXivSearchService` extends the base `SearchService` with category/author/recency boosts.
- **Neo4j** (`bolt://localhost:7687`): `CitationGraphService` writes citation nodes and edges; requires the Neo4j APOC plugin for subgraph traversal (plain Cypher fallback is active if APOC is absent).
- **Agent** (`src/services/agent/`): `project_memory_service.load_project_memories` and `citation_extraction_service` are called on the agent hot path; `draft_generation_service` is triggered by the `create_draft` destructive tool which fires a HITL interrupt before execution.
