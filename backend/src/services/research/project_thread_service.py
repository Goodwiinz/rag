"""Single source of truth for linking a chat thread to a project.

Background: a thread→project link lives in TWO places — the scalar
``thread.source_project_id`` (+ ``rag_document_scope``) and a ``project_threads``
join row. Three call sites historically wrote these independently with
divergent ``link_type``s, and the create-thread path swallowed errors, so the
two could desync (row but no column, or neither). The agent then forgot the
attached project. This helper writes BOTH in the caller's transaction so they
land together or not at all, and is idempotent so re-linking repairs a desync
instead of erroring.
