"""Owner of ALL access to the ``agent_run_events`` append-only ledger (P0-B).

PostgreSQL is authoritative for a run's event history: replay, reconnect and
audit read this table, and Redis only wakes subscribers. Rows are immutable —
this module appends and reads, it never updates or deletes an event. Nothing
else may query the table (same rule as ``agent_run_service`` for ``agent_runs``).

Design rules
------------

**Sequence allocation is server-side.** Clients never supply ``seq``. Each
append computes ``COALESCE(MAX(seq), 0) + 1`` for the run *inside the INSERT*
and relies on ``uq_agent_run_events_run_seq`` as the backstop. Concurrency
strategy, explicitly:

- Two transactions racing on the same run compute the same ``seq`` under
  READ COMMITTED (PostgreSQL's default). The loser blocks on the unique index
  until the winner commits, then raises ``IntegrityError``.
- The insert runs inside a SAVEPOINT (``begin_nested``), so that failure
  rolls back only the failed insert — the caller's transaction survives — and
  the retry re-reads a snapshot that now *includes* the winner's row, so it
  computes the next free ``seq``.
- One retry (``_MAX_APPEND_ATTEMPTS``). Exhausting it raises
  ``SequenceContentionError`` rather than skipping or guessing a ``seq``;
  gaplessness is a contract, so failing loudly beats a silent hole. In
  practice a run has one live writer plus, at most, a terminalizer.
- Under REPEATABLE READ / SERIALIZABLE the retry would re-read the same stale
  snapshot and fail again; callers using those isolation levels must retry the
  whole transaction.

A row-lock alternative (``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on ``agent_runs``) was
rejected: it serializes every append behind the run row even when there is no
contention, and it cannot be exercised by the sqlite-backed unit suite, so the
allocation path would ship untested.

**Terminal events are absorbing.** Once ``run.completed`` / ``run.failed`` /
``run.cancelled`` exists for a run, ``append_event`` refuses to append
(``RunAlreadyTerminalError``). The read-then-write check alone races, so the
partial unique index ``uq_agent_run_events_one_terminal`` enforces the same
invariant in the database; a losing racer's ``IntegrityError`` is re-classified
into ``RunAlreadyTerminalError`` on the retry pass.

**Tenancy.** ``organization_id`` is nullable (org-less users exist) and is
compared null-safely — ``== None`` compiles to ``IS NULL``. It is NEVER
stringified: ``str(None) == "None"`` has merged tenants in this codebase
before. Both ``append_event`` and ``read_events`` take ``organization_id`` as a
required keyword argument so a caller cannot silently omit the scope.

**The caller owns the transaction.** These primitives never commit and never
roll back the outer transaction, so an append can be made atomic with the
message/run writes that accompany it (P0-C).
