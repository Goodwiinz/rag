"""Agent execution service — job storage access and background graph execution.

Extracted verbatim from ``src.api.agent.jobs`` (audit B5 + C4-fold): the job
runner is an application service, not router code. Manages the async job
lifecycle for agent execution:

- Job creation/retrieval/cleanup (L1 + Redis via ``job_store``)
- Thread resolution / project binding / message persistence
- Server-side history seeding (Option B) + dual-store divergence guard
- Background graph invocation via ``_run_agent_graph``
- Graph resume after human-in-the-loop confirmation via ``_resume_agent_graph``

``src.api.agent.jobs`` remains as a thin re-export seam for legacy import
paths; new code must import from this module directly. The ``agent_runs``
Postgres projection stays in ``agent_run_service`` (its single owner).

    with deterministic-where-possible ids.

    Audit review on PR #1395 (Codex, live trace e3c56cef 2026-08-11) confirmed
    a v1 of this fix that derived every id from (thread_id, position) is
    UNSOUND: the ``/chat`` client resends only a windowed page of a long
    thread (e.g. the initial 50-message page), not the full conversation from
    turn 1 — so the index of a resent message is the index WITHIN THE WINDOW,
    not its absolute position in the thread. A later window (turns 11-60)
    replays the same indices (0-49) as an earlier one (turns 1-50), so a
    purely positional id silently REPLACES an unrelated older checkpoint
    message in place (``add_messages`` is an id-keyed upsert) — worse than the
    2x duplication this was meant to fix. This exact failure mode was already
    identified and rejected as "B1" in prior research (see memory
    project_langgraph_history_pattern.md): "adopt Option B ... supersedes B1's
    position-id scheme" — position-based ids are only sound for a client that
    resends the FULL untrimmed history, which this one does not.

    ``build_graph_input_messages`` (Option B, above) is therefore the primary,
    checkpoint-authoritative path and runs unconditionally (see call sites) —
    it never re-derives ids for resent history at all: a populated checkpoint
    gets only the newest turn (keyed on its client_message_id) appended, and
    an empty one is seeded from the DB by row identity. This function is only
    reached when Option B declines (the newest turn carries no
    client_message_id) or a DB/checkpoint read fails — restored to its
    original, pre-audit behavior: prefer client_message_id when present, else
    a (thread_id, position) fallback. That positional fallback still carries
    the same windowing risk described above, but only in this now-rare
    fallback; the alternative (inventing a safer id here) needs checkpoint
    access this sync helper doesn't have. Per review guidance, a bounded
    duplicate (the pre-audit 2x growth) is accepted here over risking silent
    in-place corruption of unrelated history — closing this fallback for good
    needs either a frontend change (resend client_message_id per history
    item, not just the newest) or leaning fully on Option B.

    """Converge a thread's HEAD checkpoint on the DB's post-edit view.

    Edit-and-resend tombstones rows in ``chat_messages``; the LangGraph
    checkpoint is a second store that must stop showing the model the turns the
    user replaced. The obvious implementation — map each tombstoned ROW to a
    checkpoint id and ``RemoveMessage`` it — cannot work: assistant messages in
    the checkpoint carry ids the MODEL generated (``run-...``, provider ids),
    which no row-derived mapping predicts, so the superseded ANSWER survived
    every removal while its question vanished.

    So this does not map. It reads what is actually present, removes ALL of it,
    and re-adds ``build_thread_seed_messages`` (which already excludes
    superseded rows) in ONE ``aupdate_state`` — the same
    ``as_node="memory_save_node"`` seam the fast path appends through, always
    against HEAD (an update carrying an earlier ``checkpoint_id`` forks the
    thread and every other writer then misses the fork). ``add_messages``
    applies the removals and the additions in list order, and an id appearing in
    both is replaced in place — verified against langgraph 1.2.4 /
    langchain-core 1.4.1 in ``test_agent_edit_resend_checkpoint.py``.

    ``add_messages`` RAISES ``ValueError`` on a ``RemoveMessage`` whose id is
    not in state. That is exactly the concurrent-writer TOCTOU: another writer
    can drop a message between our read and our write. We retry ONCE from a
    fresh read, then give up with a WARN — the DB tombstones are already
    committed and every reader filters on them, so a stale checkpoint degrades
    the model's context for one turn rather than failing the turn.

    Residual: this is not serialised against other writers to the same thread.
    A user has one live turn per thread in practice (the UI blocks a second
    send while streaming), so the single-writer assumption holds outside of
    deliberate concurrent-tab abuse; the retry covers the rest.

    Returns ``True`` when the checkpoint was rewritten, ``False`` otherwise
    (nothing to do, or a failure that was warned about). Never raises.

    was silently dropped or there is nothing to insert (no user message

    Edit-and-resend: when ``request.supersedes_client_message_id`` is set, the

    because the ``bool`` contract is asserted identity-wise (``result is True``
    / ``is False``) across the guarded wrapper's tests and eight call sites.

    rely on a single all-or-nothing commit must adapt — a partial commit
