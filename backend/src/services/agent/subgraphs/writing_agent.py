"""Writing Agent sub-graph.

Specialized for content creation, summarization, and bibliography tasks.
Tools: create_draft, create_project_note, export_bibliography,
       summarize_document, compare_documents

Shared machinery (routers, interrupt, forced synthesis, wiring) comes from
``subgraphs._factory.make_specialist_subgraph``; this module keeps only what
is genuinely writing-specific: the tool/ceiling constants, the system
prompt, and the LLM node with its grounded-synthesis path.
