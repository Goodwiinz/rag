"""Specialist-subgraph factory.

The research / writing / data subgraphs are one state machine instantiated
three times: identical node sets, identical edge wiring, and router /
interrupt / force-synthesis bodies that differed only in a name prefix, a
loop-ceiling constant, and prompt prose. This module generates those shared
parts from a per-subgraph config so the wiring exists exactly once.

What stays in the subgraph modules (genuinely different per subgraph):
the ``*_llm_node`` (research has the direct-arxiv fast path, writing has
grounded synthesis over ``retrieved_contexts``), the system-prompt builders,
and the module-level tool/ceiling constants.

Behavior contract: byte-identical to the pre-factory modules — pinned by
``tests/unit/services/test_agent_graph_topology.py``. ``tracked=False``
exists because data's nodes were never decorated with
``track_node_execution``; uniform decoration would be a (tiny) behavior
change and belongs in its own PR, not here.
