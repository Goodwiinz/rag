"""Atomic acceptance of an agent submission (P0-C).

Until this module existed, ``POST /api/v1/agent/stream`` emitted its
``accepted`` SSE frame as the first line of the generator — before a single
row was written. A crash anywhere after that frame left the client holding an
acknowledgment for a run the system had no record of: the repo's dominant
"fake-success" bug shape, at the protocol level.

``accept_submission`` closes that gap. Everything the acknowledgment implies is
written in ONE transaction and the caller may only emit ``accepted`` after it
commits:

1. the user's message row (``chat_messages``),
2. on an edit-and-resend, the tombstones that supersede the edited turn and
   everything after it (``superseded_by_message_id``),
3. the run row (``agent_runs``) the accepted frame's ``run_id`` names,
4. ``run.created`` — seq 1 of the run's ledger, via the P0-B
   ``run_event_store`` (this is its first producer),
5. an ``agent_outbox`` dispatch-intent record.

Anything that fails before the commit rolls the whole thing back: no
``accepted``, an ``error`` frame instead, and no half-written turn.

**The outbox row is a record, not a queue.** Dispatch still happens exactly as
before — the stream runs the graph in-process immediately after the commit and
``mark_submission_dispatched`` stamps the row. No relay/poller reads
``status='pending'``; building one is a later work order, and whatever does it
must re-dispatch idempotently keyed on ``run_id``.

Design notes
------------

**Transaction ownership.** ``accept_submission`` owns exactly one transaction
on the session it is handed: it commits on success and rolls back on any
failure. The per-write helpers below never commit, so the fault-injection
tests can break the chain at any statement boundary and assert nothing
survives. ``run_event_store`` was built to the same rule (it never commits),
which is what lets its append join this transaction.

**Idempotency.** The key is derived from the newest user turn's
``client_message_id`` — the field ``/execute`` already uses for the same
purpose — under a distinct ``agent-stream:`` prefix so a turn sent to both
endpoints does not collapse into one run. A resubmission of the same key by
the same user resolves to the existing run instead of creating a second one;
the ``uq_agent_runs_user_idempotency_key`` partial unique index closes the
race, and the loser re-reads the winner.

**Single writer.** ``uq_agent_runs_active_thread`` makes "one non-terminal run
per thread" a database invariant. A new submission rejects while another run
is queued, running, or stopping. A parked ``awaiting_confirmation`` run is safe
to abandon because no graph invocation is active; it is cancelled atomically
with accepting the fresh turn, then the caller clears the stale checkpoint.

**Tenancy.** ``organization_id`` is nullable (org-less users exist), compared
null-safely, and NEVER stringified — ``str(None) == "None"`` has merged tenants
in this codebase before. The one query keyed by thread rather than org
(``_ensure_thread_idle``) is scoped by construction: its ``thread_id`` comes
from ``_resolve_thread``, which joins ``Workspace.owner_id == current_user.id``,
so the thread — and therefore every run correlated to it — is already
ownership-verified. Same reasoning as ``run_event_store.has_terminal_event``,
which is keyed only by a server-generated run id.
