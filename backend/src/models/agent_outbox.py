"""Transactional-outbox record of an agent run's dispatch intent (P0-C).

One row per accepted submission, written in the SAME transaction as the user
message, the ``agent_runs`` row and the run's ``run.created`` event. That is
the whole point: a client that received an ``accepted`` frame is guaranteed a
durable record that the run was meant to be dispatched, so a crash between
acceptance and execution is recoverable instead of silently lost.

**Scope of this table today: a durable intent record only.** Dispatch itself
still happens exactly as it did before — the ``/stream`` path runs the graph
in-process, right after the accept transaction commits, and stamps
``status='dispatched'`` best-effort once the graph iterator is open. There is
no relay/poller reading ``status='pending'`` yet; building one is deliberately
a later work order. Anything that grows into that role must treat a ``pending``
row as "dispatch may or may not have happened" and re-dispatch idempotently
(the run id is the dedupe key).

All access goes through ``src/services/agent/agent_submission_service.py`` —
do not query this table directly, the same rule ``agent_run_service`` holds for
``agent_runs`` and ``run_event_store`` holds for ``agent_run_events``. Tenant
rule: ``organization_id`` is nullable (org-less users exist) and every
user-facing read MUST compare it null-safely — never ``str(org)``.
