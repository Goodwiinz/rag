"""Audit finding D (live trace thread e3c56cef, 2026-08-11): DO KB chunks were
injected into the prompt regardless of relevance score — a query about
attention mechanisms pulled 5 chunks at 0.036-0.25 cohere relevance from
unrelated cybersecurity surveys. ``_drop_low_relevance_chunks`` floors only
cohere-scored chunks (the one calibrated 0-1 scale in the code); other score
sources (rank_proxy, upstream) pass through untouched.
