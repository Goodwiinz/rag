"""Locking coverage for unlink_thread_from_project (audit B5).

Two concurrent unlinks of the same thread previously both read
``thread.source_project_id`` / ``rag_document_scope`` with a plain SELECT,
computed ``remaining_link`` from the same baseline, and raced on commit —
last writer won, leaving stale ``document_ids`` feeding RAG scope.

The transaction that mutates those columns must take the thread row lock
(``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE OF threads``) BEFORE computing ``remaining_link``.
SQLite drops FOR UPDATE at compile time, so the assertion is made on the
statement object itself (dialect-independent), plus the PostgreSQL rendering.
