"""Regression: cancelling a pending upload must release storage + quota.

cancel_upload previously did a bare `document.soft_delete()` + commit for a
pending/processing document. But the object was already uploaded to storage at
PENDING time, so that left the object orphaned AND never decremented the org's
storage usage — an upload-then-cancel loop leaked both. The fix routes through
file_service.delete_file(), which deletes the physical object, reverts the
quota, soft-deletes, and commits.
