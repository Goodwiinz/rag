"""FileService.upload_file must compensate on a post-PUT failure.

Regression guard for the upload compensating-delete gap (upload/storage/quota
hunt, 2026-07-09): the live POST /api/v1/files/upload path PUTs the object to
storage, then commits Document / quota / ProcessingJob in separate transactions
with a bare `except: rollback; raise`. A failure between the PUT and the last
step orphaned the object, stranded a PENDING row, and drifted org storage quota.

The fix reverses the DB (soft-delete row + revert quota + drop the stray job) and
then deletes the object — but only if the DB reversal actually committed, so a
correlated second failure leaves a *sweepable orphan object*, never a live row
pointing at a deleted file. The object is deleted by captured primitives, never
the (possibly expired) ORM instance.

Pure unit test — no DB, no storage; the session and storage helper are faked.
