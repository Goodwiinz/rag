"""JobStatus wire-contract truth table (audit finding C7).

The backend used to write six untyped status strings (running, completed,
awaiting_confirmation, failed, error, cancelled) while the frontend typed
four. JobStatus is now the single source of truth: five canonical members,
with "error" collapsed into FAILED (accepted as an inbound alias for one
release, never written). These tests pin the exact value set, the alias
mapping, the terminal classification, and JSON transparency — the properties
every poller, the agent_runs projection, and the frontend mirror rely on.

Deliberately imports ONLY src.shared.enums so the contract is testable
without the agent stack (no langgraph / DB deps).
