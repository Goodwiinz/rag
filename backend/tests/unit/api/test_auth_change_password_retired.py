"""Lock in the retirement of POST /auth/change-password.

The endpoint was dead by construction. It called
``AuthService.change_password``, which gated on
``verify_password(current_password, user.password_hash)`` — but under hosted
GoTrue there is no backend register/login, so ``User.password_hash`` only ever
holds the random secret written by JIT provisioning
(``src/core/user_provisioning.py``: ``get_password_hash(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))``).
No caller could ever supply that secret, so the check could never pass, and
every attempt still burned the caller's own ``chpw_ip`` / ``chpw_email``
rate-limit budget. Password changes belong to Supabase's reset-password email
flow, which already works.

This test fails if the route, the service method, or the unreachable
``EnhancedAuthService`` copy is reintroduced. If a password-change feature is
ever wanted again, it must not be rebuilt on the local ``password_hash``.
