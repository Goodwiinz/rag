"""M12 + L10 — count/page filter drift and unescaped LIKE search.

M12 (``GET /agent/threads/{id}/messages`` windowed page, execute.py): the
page query filters ``thread_id`` + ``superseded_by_message_id IS NULL`` +
(when ``before`` is set) ``created_at < before``; the count query built its
own inline filter list and silently dropped the ``before`` predicate, so any
``before=`` page reported the full-thread total instead of the filtered one
— "count queries must apply the same filters as the result query" (the
documented invariant this codebase enforces via shared ``_apply_*_filters``
helpers elsewhere).

L10 (``ProjectService.list_projects`` ``search``, project_service.py):
forwarded straight into ``Collection.name.ilike(f"%{search}%")`` with no
escaping, so a user/LLM-supplied search containing ``%``/``_`` acted as a
wildcard instead of a literal character — the LIKE-escaping invariant
already enforced at every other agent-facing ilike() site
(``tool_helpers._escape_like``, pinned by ``test_tool_helpers_like_safety.py``)
didn't reach this one.
