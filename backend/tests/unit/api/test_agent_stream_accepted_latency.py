"""The accepted-latency SLI must be measured from request arrival.

``AGENT_STREAM_ACCEPTED_DURATION`` is the SLI for "how long until the client
saw its first server frame". The clock used to be stamped when
``_SeqEmitter`` was constructed — inside the generator, i.e. *after* the route
handler had already spent wall time on rate limiting and response setup. The
one number the SLI exists to catch (pre-stream overhead) was the one number it
excluded, so a rate limiter that got slow would show up as a flat graph.

The test drives the real ``POST /stream`` handler with a rate-limiter check
that takes a measurable amount of time, pulls the first SSE frame, and asserts
the recorded observation covers that delay. With the clock stamped at emitter
construction the observation is ~0 and the test fails.

Note on libpq: ``stream_event_generator`` lazily imports ``psycopg`` inside its
body; this host may have no libpq, so a stub is installed the same way
``test_agent_streaming_revise_flag.py`` does (see nous-libpq-test-env).
