"""Freeze the public workspace API contract before Task 4.2 splits the router.

``backend/src/api/threads/workspaces.py`` (2,517 lines) exports two
``APIRouter`` objects — ``router`` (nested ``/api/v2/workspaces/...`` paths)
and ``standalone_router`` (flat ``/api/v2/...`` paths used by the frontend) —
covering 47 endpoints across workspaces, members, conversations, threads,
messages, and collections. Task 4.2 moves this into
``workspace_routes/{dependencies,presenters,workspaces,members,...}.py``. This
test pins the CURRENT wire contract (method, full path, status code,
response_model, deprecated flag) by walking the live router objects — not by
regexing source — so a behavior-preserving split can be verified against it.

This is a characterization test: it freezes what the code does today, not
what it should do. A mismatch here on ``develop`` (pre-split) is a real bug to
fix in its own commit before any structural movement; a mismatch after 4.2 is
a split that changed the public contract.

Deep RBAC/tenant/rollback behaviors are already covered elsewhere (recon:
``test_workspace_tenant_scope.py``, ``test_workspace_member_readd.py``,
``test_message_feedback_edit_guard.py``, ``backend/tests/api/threads/*``) and
are intentionally not duplicated here.
