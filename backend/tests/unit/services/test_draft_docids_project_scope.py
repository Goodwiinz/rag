"""Draft generation must scope document_ids to the project's collection.

The document_ids branch previously did `select(Document).where(Document.id.in_(...))`
with no project/org filter, so a caller (who owns project P) could pass another
tenant's document UUIDs and have their title/content synthesized into a draft
stored under P — a cross-tenant document-content leak. The fetch now always joins
collection_documents on collection_id == project_id, so foreign ids are dropped.

Compiles the built query and asserts the collection/project constraint is always
present (both with and without document_ids).
