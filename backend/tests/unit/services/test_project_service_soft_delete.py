"""Soft-deleted projects must not be listed or fetched.

Live on dev, 2026-07-27. The writing agent called ``list_projects``, took an
id straight from the result, and ``create_project_note`` refused it::

    {"projects": [{"id": "96012179-65b7-428e-a744-2207e3fddb3d",
                   "name": "synthtraffic-20260726T184029", ...}]}
    {"error": "Project not found or access denied", "error_type": "recoverable"}

That project is soft-deleted, and so were **6 of the 12** projects the service
returned for that user. ``ProjectService`` never mentioned ``is_deleted`` at
all, while every write path filters it (``_verify_project_ownership``,
``project_skills.access``, the RAG node). So the service handed out ids that
the rest of the system then rejected, and the agent burned its retry budget
on them.

Asserted against compiled SQL rather than mocked rows: the bug was a missing
predicate, and only the statement itself proves a predicate is present.
