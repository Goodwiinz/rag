"""A tool's own error classification must reach the model.

``_nodes_tools`` does not forward what a tool returns. It rebuilds the
ToolMessage::

    tool_error = classify_error_from_payload(tool_name, result)
    result_content = tool_error.to_tool_message_content()

and ``classify_error_from_payload`` read only ``payload["error"]``. So every
hand-written hint in ``tools_impl.py`` was discarded, and — worse — re-derived
as ``fatal``, which tells the agent not to recover. Measured before the fix::

    tool returns : error_type="recoverable", suggestion="list_project_documents"
    model receives: {"error": "…", "error_type": "fatal"}

Both known casualties are covered below: ``summarize_document``'s project-id
branch and its "not in your library" arXiv branch. Both were written
specifically to steer recovery, and neither survived the trip.

Assertions run against ``to_tool_message_content()`` — the string the model
actually sees. Asserting on the tool's return value is what let this hide: the
returned dict was always correct; it just never got delivered.
