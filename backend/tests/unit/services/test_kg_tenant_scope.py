"""Regression tests: KG entity search must be tenant-scoped.

Deep-audit 2026-07-16 found call sites that reached KnowledgeGraphService's
entity search WITHOUT an organization_id, so `_entity_scope_predicate` fell
through to its unscoped branch and returned entities across ALL tenants into a
user's search results. These tests assert the scope predicate is present when
an org is supplied and pin the two callers' forwarding via source inspection.
