"""Workflow contracts for the Alembic migration-check job.

The static single-head/revision-length guard is blocking. The historical
from-empty replay, ``alembic check`` drift check, and downgrade/upgrade smoke
remain visible advisory measurements because they exercise the entire legacy
chain. The evidence migration additionally has a narrow blocking delta probe:
it establishes only the exact parent-state precondition, runs the real
``evidence_prov_20260816`` upgrade, checks the two columns, downgrades to the
parent, and checks that both columns are gone.

This is a pure YAML-parse contract test (no app import, no DB), mirroring
``test_generate_openapi.py::test_contract_job_verifies_generated_typescript``.
